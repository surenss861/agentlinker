# 📅 AgentLinker Bookings System - Setup Guide

## ✅ What's Been Built

You now have a complete, production-ready **appointment scheduling and tracking system** for real estate agents!

### Core Features
- ✅ **Real-time booking dashboard** with instant updates
- ✅ **Public booking form** for clients to request showings
- ✅ **Status management** (Pending → Confirmed → Completed → Cancelled)
- ✅ **Booking timeline** with automatic event logging
- ✅ **Email & phone contact** integration
- ✅ **Listing integration** (bookings linked to properties)
- ✅ **Lead integration** (automatic lead creation from bookings)
- ✅ **Stats & analytics** (upcoming, past, status breakdown)
- ✅ **Responsive UI** with animations and real-time sync

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Step 1: Run the Database Schema

1. Open Supabase SQL Editor
2. Copy and paste the contents of `supabase-bookings-schema.sql`
3. Execute the script

This will create:
- `bookings` table (main appointment data)
- `availability` table (agent time slots - optional)
- `booking_events` table (timeline logging)
- RLS policies for security
- Auto-logging triggers

### Step 2: Test the Dashboard

1. Start your dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to `/dashboard/bookings`
3. You should see:
   - Stats summary (Total, Pending, Confirmed, Completed)
   - Empty state if no bookings yet
   - Filter buttons (All, Upcoming, Pending, etc.)

### Step 3: Test Public Booking Form

The `BookingRequestForm` component can be embedded anywhere clients interact with your listings:

```tsx
import BookingRequestForm from '@/components/BookingRequestForm'

// In your public listing page or lead form:
<BookingRequestForm
  agentId="your-agent-user-id"
  listingId="optional-listing-id"
  leadId="optional-lead-id"
  listingAddress="123 Main St, City, State"
  onSuccess={() => alert('Booking requested!')}
/>
```

## 📊 How It Works

### 1. Client Books a Showing

1. Client fills out the `BookingRequestForm` on your public page
2. Form submits to `/api/bookings` (POST)
3. Booking is inserted into Supabase with `status: 'pending'`
4. Agent's dashboard **instantly updates** via real-time subscription

### 2. Agent Manages Bookings

- **Confirm**: Changes status from `pending` → `confirmed`
- **Complete**: Changes status from `confirmed` → `completed`
- **Cancel**: Changes status to `cancelled`
- **Delete**: Removes the booking entirely

All updates trigger:
- Real-time UI updates
- Automatic event logging in `booking_events` table
- Stats recalculation

### 3. Real-Time Sync

The `useRealtimeBookings` hook:
- Subscribes to Supabase real-time changes
- Auto-updates bookings list
- Recalculates stats (total, upcoming, past, etc.)
- Handles INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE events

---

## 🎨 UI Components

### BookingsManager (`components/BookingsManager.tsx`)
- Main dashboard component
- Shows stats, filters, booking cards
- Booking detail modal
- Status management buttons

### BookingRequestForm (`components/BookingRequestForm.tsx`)
- Public-facing form for clients
- Validates required fields
- Shows success message after submission
- Can be embedded anywhere

---

## 🔐 Security (RLS Policies)

### Bookings Table
- ✅ Users can only view their own bookings
- ✅ Users can only update/delete their own bookings
- ✅ **Public (anon) can insert bookings** (for client form submissions)

### Availability Table
- ✅ Users manage their own availability
- ✅ Public can view availability (for showing available time slots)

### Booking Events Table
- ✅ Users can view events for their own bookings
- ✅ Auto-created by triggers (no manual inserts needed)

---

## 📈 Analytics & Stats

The dashboard automatically calculates:

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Total** | All bookings ever created |
| **Upcoming** | Future bookings with status `pending` or `confirmed` |
| **Past** | Past bookings or completed/cancelled status |
| **Pending** | Awaiting agent confirmation |
| **Confirmed** | Agent has confirmed the appointment |
| **Completed** | Showing was completed |
| **Cancelled** | Booking was cancelled |
| **This Month** | Bookings created in the current month |

---

## 💰 Monetization Hooks

The system includes upgrade prompts for:
- **Free tier**: View-only (limit 5 bookings/month)
- **Pro tier** ($25/mo): Unlimited bookings, email reminders
- **Business tier** ($20/mo): Team scheduling, shared calendars, analytics

To gate features:
```tsx
{userProfile.subscription_tier !== 'pro' && (
  <div className="upgrade-banner">
    Upgrade to Pro for unlimited bookings and email reminders!
  </div>
)}
```

---

## 🧩 Integration Points

### With Leads System
```tsx
// When creating a booking, pass the lead_id
<BookingRequestForm
  agentId={agent.id}
  leadId={lead.id}
  listingId={listing.id}
/>
```

### With Listings
Bookings automatically link to listings via `listing_id`. The dashboard shows the listing title and address.

### With Public Pages
Embed `BookingRequestForm` on:
- Public listing pages (`app/[slug]/listings/[id]`)
- Lead capture pages
- Agent profile pages

---

## 🚧 Future Enhancements (V2)

### Email/SMS Reminders
- Use Supabase Edge Functions
- Send reminder 24h before appointment
- Send confirmation emails

### Availability Management
- UI for agents to set available time slots
- Public form shows only available times
- Block off busy times

### Recurring Availability
- Set weekly schedules (Mon-Fri 9-5)
- Block specific dates (holidays, vacations)

### Team Scheduling (Business Tier)
- Share bookings across team members
- Assign bookings to specific agents
- Team calendar view

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Email Notifications
Use Supabase Edge Functions + Resend/SendGrid:
```typescript
// When booking status changes to 'confirmed'
await fetch('https://api.resend.com/emails', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({
    to: booking.client_email,
    subject: 'Your showing is confirmed!',
    html: `Your showing at ${listing.address} is confirmed for ${format(booking.date, 'PPP')}`
  })
})
```

### Calendar Sync
```typescript
// Generate .ics file
const icsContent = `
BEGIN:VCALENDAR
VERSION:2.0
BEGIN:VEVENT
SUMMARY:Showing at ${listing.address}
DTSTART:${format(booking.scheduled_at, "yyyyMMdd'T'HHmmss")}
DTEND:${format(addMinutes(booking.scheduled_at, booking.duration), "yyyyMMdd'T'HHmmss")}
LOCATION:${listing.address}
END:VEVENT
END:VCALENDAR
`
// Offer download or send via email
```
