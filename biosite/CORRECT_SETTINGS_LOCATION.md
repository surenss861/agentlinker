# 🔧 Correct Supabase Settings Location

## ❌ Wrong Location:
You're currently in: `Authentication → Sign In / Providers`

## ✅ Correct Location:
**Go to:** `Authentication → Emails` (not Settings)

## 🎯 What You Need to Configure:

### Step 1: Go to Email Settings
**Click on:** `Emails` in the left sidebar (under CONFIGURATION)

### Step 2: Configure Email Settings
In the Email section, you'll find:
- **Sender information** (already configured)
- **SMTP settings** (already configured with SendGrid)
- **Email templates** (need to update)

### Step 3: Update Email Templates
**Look for:** "Email Templates" section
- **Confirm signup** template (can be disabled)
- **Reset password** template (needs to be updated)

## 🚀 Alternative: Use Current Page Settings

Since you're already in "Sign In / Providers", you can:

1. **Keep "Confirm email" OFF** (it's already disabled ✅)
2. **Keep "Allow new users to sign up" ON** (it's already enabled ✅)
3. **Click "Save changes"** if you made any changes

## 📧 The Real Fix:

The password reset issue is likely in the **Email Templates** section, not the provider settings. You need to:

1. **Go to:** `Authentication → Emails`
2. **Find:** "Email Templates" 
3. **Update:** "Reset Password" template
4. **Ensure:** SMTP is properly configured

**The settings you need are in the "Emails" section, not "Settings"!** 🎯
