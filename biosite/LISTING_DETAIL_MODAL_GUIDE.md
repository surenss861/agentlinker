# Listing Detail Modal - Implementation Guide

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### Problem
The "View Details" button on the agent profile page didn't do anything - it was just a static button.

### Solution
Created a full-featured listing detail modal that shows:
- ✅ **Image gallery** with navigation arrows and dots
- ✅ **Full listing details** (price, address, bedrooms, bathrooms, sqft)
- ✅ **Complete description** (no truncation)
- ✅ **Contact agent section** with email and phone
- ✅ **Call-to-action buttons** (Send Email, Request Showing)

## 🎨 Modal Features

### 1. Image Gallery
- Displays all listing images
- Navigation arrows (← →)
- Image indicator dots
- Click dots to jump to specific image
- Shows images in full container (object-contain)

### 2. Property Details
- Large price display at top
- Property stats in cards (beds, baths, sqft)
- Full address with icon
- Complete description (not truncated)

### 3. Contact Agent
- Agent name
- Email link (opens mail client with subject pre-filled)
- Phone link (opens phone dialer)
- "Send Email" button
- "Request Showing" button (scrolls to contact form)

### 4. User Experience
- ✅ Click outside modal to close
- ✅ Click X button to close
- ✅ ESC key support (browser default)
- ✅ Smooth animations
- ✅ Mobile responsive
- ✅ Dark theme matching site design
